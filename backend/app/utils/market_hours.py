"""
US equity/options market-hours helper.

Used to gate order execution so the system only sends orders during regular
trading hours (RTH, 09:30–16:00 ET, Mon–Fri, excluding exchange holidays).
The app keeps running 24/7 (reconnects, classifies regime, generates signals);
only order submission is paused outside RTH and resumes automatically at the open.
