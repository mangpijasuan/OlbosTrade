Account State — single source of truth for "what is the account worth right now."

Previously this exact fetch-with-fallback snippet was duplicated three times
(trade_desk.py's guardrail state, main.py's options sizing) with two other call
sites (main.py's equity trade-plan sizing, portfolio.py's heat %) hardcoded to
the static settings.starting_capital instead — meaning equity position sizing
and portfolio heat were computed against a number that could be far from the
real, live account value. One function, used everywhere a live account value
is needed.
