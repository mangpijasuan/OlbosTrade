# OlbosTrade — IB Gateway watchdog
#
# The gnzsnz/ib-gateway container can stay "Up" while the IB Gateway app inside it
# stops serving its API port (the classic IBKR daily-restart hang). When that
# happens the backend logs endless "TimeoutError / Failed to connect to IBKR".
#
# This script checks liveness by reading the backend's own /api/health/detail
# (already-running FastAPI process, no new socket to the gateway) and restarts
# the gateway container only when that snapshot looks dead — with a cooldown so
# it doesn't restart again during the ~90s it takes the gateway to log back in.
#
# PRIOR VERSION BUG (found 2026-08-25): this used to open a second, independent
# ib_insync connection (clientId=99) as its liveness probe. Correlating gateway
# logs against this cron's own schedule proved that connection was the direct
# cause of "remove Client 2" disconnects on the app's real session — IB Gateway
# kicked the existing clientId=2 session every single time this probe connected
# (~286-288 collisions/day while the cron ran, essentially zero when it didn't;
# see the plan doc's "Out-of-band incident" section for the full log analysis).
# The fix opening a second connection was supposed to catch was real, but the
# probe's own side effect was worse than the daily hang it existed to catch —
# so this version checks the app's already-open connection's self-reported
# state instead of ever dialing a second one.
#
# PRIOR VERSION BUG #2 (found 2026-08-27): the fix above also added a second
# condition to the probe — `queue_depth.P0 < 30` — on the theory that a deep
# queue meant the connection was unresponsive even if isConnected() hadn't
# noticed. That predicate is self-reinforcing and cannot clear itself:
# restarting the GATEWAY cannot drain an APP-side queue, it deepens it (the
# restart drops the connection, in-flight coordinator requests are shielded so
# they hang rather than cancel, and the scanners keep enqueueing). Once the
# queue crossed 30 the probe could never return OK again, so this watchdog
# restarted the gateway every COOLDOWN seconds indefinitely — 9 restarts
# between 02:20 and 07:00 alone, each exactly 15 minutes apart. Downstream that
# produced a 99.3% ACCOUNT_SUMMARY timeout rate, a fabricated Total Equity on
# the dashboard (the summary route silently falls back to capital + realized
# P&L when the broker read fails), and margin guardrails running blind while
# autopilot was on. Two lessons, both now encoded below:
#   1. Only restart on a condition the restart can actually fix. For a gateway
#      restart that is exactly one thing: the socket is down.
#   2. Any unattended remediation needs a circuit breaker. If N restarts in a
#      window all fail to restore health, restarting is not the answer —
#      stop and surface it rather than loop forever.
#
# Intended to run from cron every few minutes (see install_ibkr_watchdog.sh).
