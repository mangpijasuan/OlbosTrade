/**
 * A hub page's TAB belongs in the URL too.
 *
 * #58 put the page in the URL. One level down, the hub pages kept their active
 * tab in local state and told nobody: clicking a tab called setTab and stopped
 * there, so the address bar still read /terminal/risk/heat while you were
 * looking at Guardrails. Reload, bookmark, share and Back then restored the
 * page but not the tab — the same class of silent wrongness, one level in.
 *
 * Most of these tabs already had their own page key in App.tsx (risk:heat and
 * risk:rules are both RiskCenter), so the URL could always name them. Nothing
 * was routing the change through it.
 *
 * Browser tests because the claim is about the address bar, a real reload and
 * real session history. jsdom has none of those.
 *
 * NOTE: the tab control is `role="tab"`, not a button. An explicit role
 * overrides the implicit one, so getByRole("button") matches nothing here —
 * the same trap as the account menu's `role="menuitem"`.

 * (reading 'toLowerCase')"). Its ErrorBoundary catches it and renders "Page
 * content failed to render" — so the tab bar never mounts and there is nothing
 * to click. Risk, System and Signals tolerate the empty payload; Research does
 * not.
 *
 * Giving Research a hand-shaped fixture would make this test depend on one
 * page's response schema, which is exactly the coupling the flat `{}` stub
 * avoids. The tab wiring it would prove is instead asserted in
 * src/hooks/__tests__/useTabRoute.test.tsx, which checks every hub's tab table
 * against the real page registry — Research included.
